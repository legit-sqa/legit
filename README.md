# Legit

This new respository contains the files from the old legit repository. It has been
copied rather than forked as the project is going in a new direction (to be a standalone
wrapper rather than a product in its own right) and as such Git's source code, and associated
massive history, is not required.

This repository is not meant to work in its current state. This is simply the first commit
to move the files over which will then be worked on.
